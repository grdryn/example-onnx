= Models

This directory contains the spleen-seg model, in a directory structure
expected by Triton, and in a way that it can be consumed by the ODH
aiedge-e2e pipeline.

There's also a config.pbtxt file included in the spleen-seg/
directory, which will be read by tritonserver at startup, to be able
to load the model as expected.
