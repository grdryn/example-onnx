= Example PipelineRuns

== Prerequisites

* All of these examples push images to quay.io, so a Secret containing
  a credential that can write to those repositories is needed. See the
  https://github.com/opendatahub-io/ai-edge/tree/main/pipelines#setup-credentials[instructions
  in the upstream repo] for more details.

* For the
  link:spleen-seg-openvino-s3.pipelinerun.yaml[spleen-seg-openvino-s3.pipelinerun.yaml]
  example, a credential is needed to be able to fetch the model from
  S3-compatible object storage. See the
  https://github.com/opendatahub-io/ai-edge/tree/main/pipelines#setup-credentials[instructions
  in the upstream repo] for more details.

* A PersistentVolumeClaim needs to exist, and be bound to a
  PersistentVolume that contains an example inference request and
  response, which can be used for the test stage of the pipeline.  See
  link:./populate-test-data/README[the populate-test-data README] for
  the steps to do this.

== Examples

=== OpenVINO-based image, model from S3

The
link:spleen-seg-openvino-s3.pipelinerun.yaml[spleen-seg-openvino-s3.pipelinerun.yaml]
example fetches the model from S3-compatible object storage, and
packages it into an image along with the OpenVINO model server.

=== Triton-based image, model from Git

The
link:spleen-seg-triton.pipelinerun.yaml[spleen-seg-triton.pipelinerun.yaml]
example fetches the model from this Git repository as part of the
pipeline, and packages it into an image along with the Triton model
server.

=== Create a PipelineRun from one of these examples

These examples are expected to be declared using:

[source,sh]
----
oc create -f <PipelineRun file>
----

They're not expected to work with `oc apply`, because of the
`generateName` metadata field that generates the name.
