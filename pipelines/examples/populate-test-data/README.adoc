== Populate PVC with test data

To be able to run pipeline successfully, test data needs to be
provided, in the form of a `data.json` file with an input inference
request payload, and `output.json` containing an example successful
response.

Since the files for the spleen-seg model are too large to put into a
ConfigMap, we'll put them into a PersistentVolume, and then retain the
PersistentVolumeClaim for use as a workspace in the Pipeline.

== Create PVC and a pod to be used with `oc cp`

[source,console]
----
$ oc apply -f resources.yaml
----

== Copy files into PV through pod

[source,console]
----
$ oc cp data.json ephemeral-test-data-populator:/mnt/spleen-seg-test-data/data.json
$ oc cp output.json ephemeral-test-data-populator:/mnt/spleen-seg-test-data/output.json
----

== Delete pod once files are copied

[source,console]
----
$ oc delete pod ephemeral-test-data-populator
----
